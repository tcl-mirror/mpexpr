This version of Mpexpr was created by William Foss of IBM,
and compiles without modification on at least RedHat 7.1.
If you desire to contact Mr. Foss, I will be happy to
forward your note.

Very little work was done with version titles and so forth,
but this is the official Mpexpr 1.1, regardless of what the
DLL says.

This version is mostly around for historical reasons, as
the new codebase should be forthcoming.
