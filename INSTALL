Mpexpr INSTALL


1. You will need to have Tcl already installed.  See the README
   for where to get them.  You should have compiled, (or at least
   configured) Tcl with '--enable-shared'.


2. Run "./configure".  

   You should specify the same --prefix and --exec-prefix as you did when 
   you configured Tcl.  The defaults are /usr/local.

   ./configure --prefix=/usr/local  --exec-prefix=/usr/local


   Configure will use the --prefix= --exec-prefix= to 
   find the Tcl library and config files (lib/tclX.Y and lib/tclConfig.sh).

   ./configure has three options, 
				--disable-shared
				--with-tclx
				--with-tk


   When building the Mpexpr extension, the default is to build a shared 
   library that can be loaded using 'package require Mpexpr'.  
   Tcl MUST ALSO have been configured with '--enable-shared'.  The configure
   script and Makefile uses information from the tclConfig.sh file that
   deals with compiling and linking shared libraries.

   You can build a static library and executable by specifing 
   '--disable-shared' as a configure option.   If you noramlly use 
   Extended Tcl, you can build an executable with Tcl, TclX, and Mpexpr
   by using the configure option '--with-tclx'.
   You can also build wish and wishx interpreters using the configure
   option '--with-tk'.


3. Run "make"

   This will compile and build Mpexpr, either as a shared library or
   static library and executables.

   Again, your Tcl installation MUST HAVE BEEN BUILT with '--enable-shared'
   if you have configured to build the shared library.


4. Run "make test"

   This will run through test scripts for mpexpr and mpformat.


5. Run "make install".

   This step will install Mpexpr shared library and pkgIndex.tcl or
   static libraries and executables.
   If you built the shared library, you can use Mpexpr in your Tcl
   programs by using the 'package require Mpexpr' command.
